 Stability
 
 1) Find ground state
 2) Nudge component-wise
 3) Energetic improvement?
 4) Increase nudge
 5) Results in energy cost and direction to destabilize

//state

/*double entropy
...
 count the number of equivalent ground states to demonstrate instability
 1) Find Ground state
 2) Nudge or Search
 3) -If equivalent, keep
    -If lower, begin again
 4) Result in collection of ground states
 

How to make this measurement Have a more general meaning...
    -Statistics in collected and tossed
